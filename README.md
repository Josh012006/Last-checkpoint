# Last-checkpoint
I'm really happy to have completed the bootcamp. I'm excited to start my career path for real. It's true that it is a bit scary when I think about taking my first interview and I really want to pass it. I pray that Jesus helps me succeed.

Regarding the skills learned I think as you're going toward the end you realise more and more their uses. Every skill is important and I think each one can learn them. It just requires a bit of patient, hard work and training.

Thanks!
